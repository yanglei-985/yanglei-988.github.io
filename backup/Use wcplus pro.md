> When I find the tool,I am quite excited,because I could find the resources in the Wechat,and get all the things from the place.like lonely reader.
And then,I will introduce how to make use of it,and my experience of using it.

The [github link](https://github.com/wonderfulsuccess/weixin_crawler)and the [website](https://www.wcplus.cn/?s=g).

Because the company charges a high price,nowadays I cannot afford it,but it gives us one hour free time to use it,and I have download all the txts from lonereader,and ohter Wechat official acount.

And we can follow the steps from the website,like downing the file to operate in your computer.
